Oricutron ChangeLog

0.2 (08-Feb-2010)
-----------------

* Fullscreen now works properly on OS4
* A LOT more disk based software will work that just
  froze up before.
* Much, much better audio
* New layout for the AY info in the debugger


0.1 (06-Feb-2010)
-----------------

General:

 * Now called "Oricutron". Apparently Oriculator is
   rude in some languages :-)
 * Works well enough to deserve "0.1" instead of "0.0.x"
 * You can now auto-insert a tape by passing its name to
   CLOAD. If you need to "CLOAD" a specific file within
   a tape image, you can disable this feature.
 * Fixed broken FPS display
 * Fixed a condition where a filehandle wouldn't get closed.
 * Added a 16k Oric-1 mode
 * Added commandline options
 * Fixed ADC/SBC overflow flag bug
 * Mouse click now opens the main menu
 * Fixed hard lockup when executing BRKs constantly
 * Fixed B flag bug
 * Fixed carry flag in BCD mode SBC
 * Fixed behaviour or N and Z flags in decimal mode
 * Fixed flag issue in TXS
 * Emulation speed is no longer tied to the audio callback,
   enabling more reasonably sized audio buffers.
 * 60Hz attribute emulated
 * Fullscreen mode (only available via commandline for now)

Disk:

 * Massive improvements to disk support. Reading works
   for most things (only Read Track is not implemented
   yet). Writing is not implemented at all.
 * Added support for the Jasmin disk controller. Press
   F4 to reboot in disk mode when jasmin is enabled.

Debugger/Monitor:

 * Added memwatch window
 * Added symbols support
 * Implemented help command (?)
 * F11 traces code without going into subroutines
   (or Shift+F10 on Amiga keyboards)
 * F12 now skips instructions 
 * Breakpoints now survive any reset unless the machine type
   is changes.
 * You can now set breakpoints on memory accesses as well
   as program execution
 * Memory reads from monitor no longer cause side effects
   for VIA and disk


0.0.2 (06-Apr-2009)
-------------------

 * Blink attribute emulated
 * Removed the need for a mutex in the sound framework, which
   gives a good speed up.
 * AY sound works, more or less (needs much more work :)
 * FPS display is now averaged over 8 frames
 * Sends an extra zero-byte at the end of .tap files. This seems
   to make more tapes load (e.g. MazezaM), but I don't know why.
   Needs further investigation.


0.0.1 (31-Mar-2009)
-------------------

 * Just an early preview. Please do not report bugs or
   judge it too harshly. The emulator is not really
   ready for a release yet :-)
