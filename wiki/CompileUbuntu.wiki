#summary How to compile Oricutron for Ubuntu

= Introduction =

This page describes how to compile Oricutron for Ubuntu (instructions correct for Ubuntu 12.04)

  * Install SDL devloper files with "sudo apt-get install libsdl-dev libgtk-3-dev"
  * Make sure you have the GNU C++ compiler support installed: "sudo apt-get install g++"
  * Either download and extract a source package from the [http://code.google.com/p/oriculator/downloads/list download page], or [http://code.google.com/p/oriculator/source/checkout check out] the current subversion trunk.
  * Open a shell, and navigate to the Oricutron sourcecode
  * Type "make".

Hopefully, an Oricutron executable should come out the other end.
