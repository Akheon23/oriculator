#summary How to compile Oricutron for Debian

= Introduction =

This page describes how to compile Oricutron for Ubuntu (instructions correct for Debian unstable)

  * Install SDL, GTK and OpenGL developer files with (as root) "apt-get install libsdl-dev libgtk-3-dev libgl1-mesa-dev"
  * Make sure you have the GNU C++ compiler support installed: "sudo apt-get install g++"
  * Either download and extract a source package from the [https://bintray.com/pete/generic/Oricutron download page], or [http://code.google.com/p/oriculator/source/checkout check out] the current subversion trunk.
  * Open a shell, and navigate to the Oricutron sourcecode
  * Type "make".

Hopefully, an Oricutron executable should come out the other end.
