This page describes how to compile Oricutron

  * Install [http://www.morphos.de/downloads SDK] and PowerSDL
  * Either download and extract a source package from the [https://bintray.com/pete/generic/Oricutron download page], or [http://code.google.com/p/oriculator/source/checkout check out] the current subversion trunk.
  * You may download [http://aminet.net/package/util/arc/unzip-morphos unzip] for end of line convertion
  * Open a shell, and navigate to the Oricutron archive
  * For example type:
{{{unzip -a Downloads:Oricutron_src_v09.zip -d oricutron}}}
  * Type:
{{{make}}}

Hopefully, an Oricutron executable should come out the other end.
