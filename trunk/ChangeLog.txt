Oriculator ChangeLog

0.0.3 (xx-xxx-xxxx)
-------------------

 * Fixed broken FPS display
 * You can now auto-insert a tape by passing its name to
   CLOAD. If you need to "CLOAD" a specific file within
   a tape image, you can disable this feature.
 * Fixed a condition where a filehandle wouldn't get closed.
 * Added memwatch window to the monitor
 * Implimented help command (?) in monitor
 * Added memory access breakpoints
 * Added a 16k Oric-1 mode


0.0.2 (06-Apr-2009)
-------------------

 * Blink attribute emulated
 * Removed the need for a mutex in the sound framework, which
   gives a good speed up.
 * AY sound works, more or less (needs much more work :)
 * FPS display is now averaged over 8 frames
 * Sends an extra zero-byte at the end of .tap files. This seems
   to make more tapes load (e.g. MazezaM), but I don't know why.
   Needs further investigation.


0.0.1 (31-Mar-2009)
-------------------

 * Just an early preview. Please do not report bugs or
   judge it too harshly. The emulator is not really
   ready for a release yet :-)
