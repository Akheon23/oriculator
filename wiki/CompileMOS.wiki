#summary How to compile Oricutron for MorphOS

= Introduction =

This page describes how to compile Oricutron

  * Install [http://www.morphos.de/downloads SDK] and PowerSDL
  * Either download and extract a source package from the [https://bintray.com/pete/generic/Oricutron download page], or [http://code.google.com/p/oriculator/source/checkout check out] the current subversion trunk.
  * Open a shell, and navigate to the Oricutron archive
  * For example type "unzip -a Downloads:Oricutron_src_v09.zip -d oricutron"
  * Type "make".

Hopefully, an Oricutron executable should come out the other end.
