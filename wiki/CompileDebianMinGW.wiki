#summary How to cross-compile Oricutron with MinGW under Debian

= Introduction =

This page describes how to cross-compile Oricutron for Windows with [http://www.mingw.org/ MinGW] under Debian (instructions correct for Debian unstable).

  * Install MinGW cross-compiler with (as root):
{{{apt-get install mingw32}}}
  * Download the latest SDL development libraries for MinGW from [http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php the libSDL 1.2 download page].
  * Install the SDL development libraries to /usr/local/i586-mingw32msvc/SDL-1.2.15 FIXME!
  * Either download and extract a source package from the [https://bintray.com/pete/generic/Oricutron download page], or [http://code.google.com/p/oriculator/source/checkout check out] the current subversion trunk.
  * Open a shell, and navigate to the Oricutron sourcecode
  * To compile we must override the platform autodetection and pass over the path to SDL headers and libs. Type:
{{{make PLATFORM=win32 SDL_PREFIX=/usr/local/i586-mingw32msvc/SDL-1.2.15}}}

Hopefully, an Oricutron executable should come out the other end.
